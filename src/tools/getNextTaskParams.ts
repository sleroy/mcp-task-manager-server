Identifies and returns the next actionable task within a specified project.
A task is considered actionable if its status is 'todo' and all its dependencies (if any) have a status of 'done'.
If multiple tasks are ready, the one with the highest priority ('high' > 'medium' > 'low') is chosen.
If priorities are equal, the task created earliest is chosen.
Returns the full details of the next task, or null if no task is currently ready.
